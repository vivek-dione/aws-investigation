## Risk Assessment

### Operational Risks
- **🔴 High:** Uncontrolled network traffic through public internet
- **🔴 High:** Open port 9651 to entire internet (0.0.0.0/0)
- **🟡 Medium:** Lack of traffic monitoring/alerting
- **🟡 Medium:** No cost anomaly detection in place

### Security Considerations
- **Port 9651 Exposure:** Application accessible from any IP address globally
- **Traffic Volume:** Unusual surge suggests either:
  - Planned application scaling without cost analysis
  - Potential security incident or unauthorized usage
  - Application malfunction causing excessive network activity

### Financial Risks
- **Immediate:** $250/day unbudgeted costs
- **Scaling:** If traffic continues to grow, costs could escalate further
- **Budget Impact:** $91,250 annual unplanned expenditure

## Conclusion

The July 10th cost spike was caused by a dramatic increase in data transfer costs related to an application running on port 9651 across 75 EC2 instances. While the instances were launched in October 2024, the traffic surge began July 10, 2025, suggesting either:

1. **Planned scaling:** Application reached a threshold requiring increased network communication
2. **Configuration change:** Settings modified to enable higher traffic volumes  
3. **External factors:** Increased demand or new integration requiring data exchange

**Immediate action is required** to investigate the port 9651 application, assess its necessity, and implement appropriate security and cost controls to prevent similar incidents in the future.

## Verification Methodology & Confidence Assessment

### **Current Evidence Confidence: 75-80%** ⚠️

**CONFIRMED Evidence:**
- ✅ Cost spike: $94.96/day increase starting July 10th
- ✅ Primary cause: DataTransfer-Out-Bytes (internet egress traffic)
- ✅ Affected infrastructure: 75 c5.xlarge instances across 5 AWS Core accounts
- ✅ Port 9651 exposed: Security group allows global internet access
- ✅ Coordinated timing: All accounts spiked simultaneously

**INFERRED Evidence (Requires Verification):**
- 🔍 Port 9651 as primary traffic source (based on security group analysis)
- 🔍 Validator sync as root cause (based on application description)
- 🔍 Traffic volume calculations (derived from cost data)

### **Manager Verification Checklist**

To achieve **100% certainty**, perform these verification steps:

#### **Immediate Verification (5-10 minutes)**
```bash
# SSH into any AWS Core instance and run:

# 1. Verify active connections on port 9651
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep 9651
sudo ss -tulpn | grep 9651

# 2. Check process using port 9651
sudo lsof -i :9651

# 3. Monitor real-time network traffic by port
sudo iftop -P                    # Shows traffic by port
sudo nethogs                     # Shows traffic by process

# 4. Check validator sync process status
ps aux | grep -i validator
ps aux | grep -i sync
```

#### **Historical Traffic Analysis (15-30 minutes)**
```bash
# 5. Check system logs for July 10th validator activity
sudo journalctl --since "2025-07-10 00:00:00" --until "2025-07-10 23:59:59" | grep -i validator
sudo journalctl --since "2025-07-10 00:00:00" --until "2025-07-10 23:59:59" | grep 9651

# 6. Examine network interface statistics
cat /proc/net/dev                # Network interface byte counters
sar -n DEV 1 10                  # Real-time network statistics

# 7. Check application-specific logs
sudo find /var/log -name "*validator*" -o -name "*sync*" | head -10
sudo tail -f /path/to/validator/logs/sync.log    # Replace with actual log path
```

#### **Network Flow Analysis (Advanced - 30+ minutes)**
```bash
# 8. Capture network traffic on port 9651 (run for 5 minutes)
sudo tcpdump -i any port 9651 -c 1000 -w /tmp/port9651_capture.pcap

# 9. Analyze captured traffic
sudo tcpdump -r /tmp/port9651_capture.pcap | head -20

# 10. Check bandwidth usage by destination
sudo netstat -i
sudo iftop -i eth0 -P -N        # Replace eth0 with actual interface
```

#### **Correlation Verification**
```bash
# 11. Compare Netdata traffic (should be minimal compared to validator sync)
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep 19999
sudo lsof -i :19999

# 12. Check RPC endpoint traffic (should be lower than sync traffic)
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep 9650
sudo lsof -i :9650

# 13. Verify timing correlation with cost spike
# Check application logs for configuration changes around July 10th
sudo find /etc -name "*validator*" -o -name "*sync*" -exec ls -la {} \; | grep "Jul 10"
```

### **Expected Verification Results**

**If port 9651 IS the culprit:**
- `netstat/lsof` will show validator sync process bound to port 9651
- `iftop/nethogs` will show high bandwidth usage from validator process
- Traffic capture will show constant outbound data streams
- Logs will show validator sync activity starting/intensifying around July 10th

**If port 9651 is NOT the culprit:**
- Low/no traffic observed on port 9651
- High traffic will be attributed to different ports/processes
- Will need to investigate other network-intensive applications

### **Risk Assessment if Verification is Delayed**

**High Confidence Factors:**
- Perfect timing correlation across 5 accounts
- Traffic volume matches blockchain validator patterns
- Security configuration aligns with validator requirements

**Potential Alternative Causes (if port 9651 ruled out):**
- Different port running validator sync (misconfig)
- Netdata streaming with very high resolution/custom metrics
- Unknown application generating traffic
- Multiple applications contributing simultaneously

### **Recommended Action Plan**

1. **Immediate (Today):** Run verification commands on 2-3 instances
2. **If confirmed:** Proceed with validator sync optimization recommendations
3. **If not confirmed:** Expand investigation to all open ports and running processes
4. **Document findings:** Update this report with verification results
