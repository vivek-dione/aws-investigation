# AWS Cost Investigation: Odyssey Network Bootstrap Validators

## 🎯 Overview

This repository contains the complete investigation into high AWS outbound data transfer costs on Odyssey Network bootstrap validators. The investigation revealed that the network is operating normally and the high costs are expected for a network of this size.

## 📊 Quick Summary

- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - No security issues detected
- **Root Cause:** Normal network operation with 89 legitimate validators
- **Cost Impact:** 7.7TB incoming, 6.8TB outgoing per bootstrap node
- **Optimization Potential:** 20-30% cost reduction through configuration changes
- **Timeline:** Immediate implementation possible

## 🔍 Investigation Results

### What We Found
- **89 legitimate validators** properly connected to bootstrap nodes
- **Perfect 1:1 connection ratio** (no abuse or attacks)
- **High data transfer is expected** for bootstrap node operation
- **Network is healthy and secure**

### What We Did NOT Find
- ❌ No security threats or DDoS attacks
- ❌ No connection abuse or exhaustion
- ❌ No network misconfiguration
- ❌ No performance issues

## 💰 Cost Optimization Strategies

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. **Enable network compression** in validator configs
2. **Set connection limits** to prevent future abuse
3. **Implement message size limits** to reduce data transfer
4. **Monitor costs** for next 48 hours

### Expected Results
- **20-30% cost reduction** through compression and optimization
- **Maintained network stability** and performance
- **Better resource utilization** across bootstrap nodes
- **Predictable cost structure** for your network
